Once your model is defined, it can be trained. This can happen on a single thread or on a parallel framework like Watson Machine Learning or Apache Spark. In the most simple case Model Definition and Model Training is just a couple of LOCs (lines of code) away. In the case of Watson Machine Learning or Apache Spark models might need to get serialized and transferred to another technology / framework.

Please specify and justify the technologies used for model definition and training in the ADD. 

Once you think you have achieved a descent model performance save the notebook according to the process model’s naming convention and proceed to the model evaluation task.
